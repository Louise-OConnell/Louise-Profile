## About Me 

I live in Wakefield, in West Yorkshire. 

I am extremely artistic, and alongside my passion for learning how to code, I also enjoy: design, illustration, and creative writing. 

I first discovered my passion for coding during the first UK lockdown - during my participation in a 5 day coding challenge, with the code institute. 

I am currently studying JAMstack Web/App Development with [the coder's guild](https://thecodersguild.org.uk/), and I really love how creative coding can be. 

My other interests include:

* Reading

* Baking (cherry chocolate cake is the best!)

* Oracle Cards (mainly for myself)

* Nature Walks

* Movies (big star wars fan!)

* Music

# Hey, I'm Louise, welcome to my profile.

## About Me 

I live in Wakefield, in West Yorkshire. 

I am extremely artistic, and alongside my passion for learning how to code, I also enjoy: design, illustration, and creative writing. 

I own my own eco-clothing brand [Louise Lake Designs](https://louiselakedesigns.teemill.com/), where I create designs for organic cotton clothing and art prints on recycled paper. 

I first discovered my passion for coding during the first UK lockdown - during my participation in a 5 day coding challenge [5 Day Coding Challenge](https://codeinstitute.net/5-day-coding-challenge/), with [The Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). 

I am currently studying JAMstack Web/App Development with [The Coder's Guild](https://thecodersguild.org.uk/), and I really love how creative coding can be. 

My other interests include:

* Reading

* Baking (cherry chocolate cake is the best!)

* Oracle Cards 

* Nature Walks

* Movies (big star wars fan!)

* Music

* Protecting animals and the environment (friends not food!)
